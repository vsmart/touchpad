Make sure you have python 2.x installed on your machine
and installed the nltk library.

There is no main function but the separate functions may be 
loaded individually in the repl 
to see results, e.g. split_into_pairs ('hallo'). 

To inspect the code simply open the files in your favourite 
text editor. Function documentation is included there.
